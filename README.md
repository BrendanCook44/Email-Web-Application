# Email Web Application
Developed by Brendan Cook for coursework at The University of Toledo

This thin-client application allows the user to send emails and store email contents within the application as well as provides the option to show, delete or print the email contents sent through the application.  

To run the application properly, open the .sln file within Visual Studio and click the run button.

You will first be greeted with a login page prompting the user for a username and a password:    
Username = "username"  
Password is "password"    
(very secure, I know)

After logging into the application, you will have the option to send an email. To send an email, type in the recipient, subject, and body portions
within the text fields and press the send button to open the email client. When the send button is pressed, the application will ask you to choose an email client
to use for sending the email. The recipient, subject, and body info given within the application will copy over to the email client when selected. 
After sending the email within the client, refer back to the table in the application for additional capabilities and information. From here, you will have the option
to show all of the sent email information, delete the email information from the application, or print out the email information.
